I actually made a ".jar" file out of my source code which is in java. I could not upload my ".jar" file on GitHub. The only thing needed to execute the program were as follows:

Steps to execute program:

1. Verify you have latest version of JAVA jre/jdk on ur machine i.e. 1.8
   If not, install it.

2. Put "tweets.txt" in a folder anywhere
   for e.g. C:\folderA\folderB\tweet.txt

3. Paste the "TwitterProject.jar" on your machine anywhere (e.g. Desktop)

4. Double click and run the TwitterProject.jar file. A pop up will come asking for address.

5. Enter the directory where you have kept the tweets.txt file
  (in this case your input should be  C:\folderA\folderB)

6. Press Enter

7. Two output files ft1.txt and ft2.txt will get generated in C:\folderA\folderB (in the same direectory of "tweets.txt")
  
OR (For Linux)

1. Verify you have latest version of JAVA jre/jdk on ur machine i.e. 1.8
   If not, install it.

2. Make sure "tweets.txt", "TwitterProject.jar" and "run.sh" are in the same directory.

3. Open the "Terminal" and go to the directory in which the above files are stored.

4. Type "sh run.sh". The "Twitter.jar" file will run and will ask for the directory of the "tweets.txt" file. Enter the directory.

5. Press Enter and you will see two output files "ft1.txt" and "ft2.txt" generated in the same directory as the "tweets.txt" file.


I have attached my source code and it is working perfectly fine giving the desired ouputs (both ft1.txt and ft2.txt) and that too most accurately. I was unsure about how you are going to run my program and how am I supposed to write my shell scipt for the same. I combined both the required features into a single program (".jar" file) which only required the directory of the "tweets.txt" file and it would generate the output files "ft1.txt" and "ft2.txt" in the same directory.

I assure you I have a perfectly running program which you can test using my ".jar" file. Unfortunately, I could not write a shell file as requested by you but instead I made a ".jar file". Kindly allow me to submit my jar file through any other mean and let me know how can I send you my file.
